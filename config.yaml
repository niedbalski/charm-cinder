    type: boolean
    description: Enable verbose logging.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False

      Setting this to True will allow supporting services to log to syslog.
  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string
    description: |
      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * ...

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade.
  openstack-origin-git:
    default:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies a default OpenStack release name, or a YAML dictionary
      listing the git repositories to install from.

      The default Openstack release name may be one of the following, where
      the corresponding OpenStack github branch will be used:
        * liberty
        * mitaka
        * master

      The YAML must minimally include requirements and cinder repositories,
      and may also include repositories for other dependencies:
        repositories:
        - {name: requirements,
           repository: 'git://github.com/openstack/requirements',
           branch: master}
        - {name: cinder,
           repository: 'git://github.com/openstack/cinder',

    type: string
    description: |
      The block devices on which to create LVM volume group.

      May be set to None for deployments that will not need local
      storage (eg, Ceph/RBD-backed volumes).

      This can also be a space delimited list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder LVM volume group - each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.

      May be set to the path and size of a local file
      (/path/to/file.img|$sizeG), which will be created and used as a
      loopback device (for testing only).  $sizeG defaults to 5G
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    default: 3
    type: int
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores withing the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  volume-group:
    default: cinder-volumes
    type: string
    description: Name of volume group to create and store Cinder volumes.
  overwrite:
    default: "false"
    type: string
    description: |
      If true, charm will attempt to overwrite block devices containing
      previous filesystems or LVM, assuming it is not in use.
  remove-missing:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, if logical volumes are not allocated on them.
  remove-missing-force:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, even when logical volumes are allocated on them. This
      option overrides 'remove-missing' when set.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephermeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Providing this option will force an unmount of the ephemeral device
      so that it can be used as a Cinder storage device.  This is useful for
      testing purposes (cloud deployment is not a typical use case).
  database-user:
    default: cinder
    type: string
    description: Username to request database access.

  use-internal-endpoints:
    default: False
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for
      internal communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  glance-api-version:
    default: 1
    type: int
    description: |
      Newer storage drivers may require the v2 Glance API to perform certain
      actions e.g. the RBD driver requires requires this to support COW
      cloning of images. This option will default to v1 for backwards
      compatibility older glance services.
  # HA configuration settings
  dns-ha:
    type: boolean
    default: False

  # Per-service HTTPS configuration.
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports.  Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Cinder's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certficiate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).

  os-public-hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The hostname or address of the public endpoints created for cinder
      in the keystone identity provider.

      This value will be used for public endpoints. For example, an
      os-public-hostname set to 'cinder.example.com' with ssl enabled will
      create two public endpoints for cinder:

      enabled will create two internal endpoints for cinder:

  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.

      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.

    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0

      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
